# BUTTCOIN v2.0 OWNERSHIP POLL

Currently, the ButtCoin (0xBUTT version 2.0) is a project/token that has an owner. Having an ownership has the pros and cons. The main concern while having an ownership is that although on a decentralized platform, the project itself has a central governing authority. This poll is asking the community to decide whether to turn this central authority off or whether to let it remain. There are 2 options:

### OPTION 1: Remove the ownership and the administrator accounts, everyone should have equal rights.

### OPTION 2: Leave it as is.

This is what the pros and cons are to option 1.

Option 2 is same as 1 but with everything enabled.

Pros: 
- There is no central authority.
- Everyone has equal rights to be involved with the project and do whatever they want with the tokens they have. 
- Nobody has to trust anyone, and ButtCoin developers are not responsible for ButtCoin anymore. 
- It is a 100% community driven project. 
- ButtCoin admins cannot manipulate the project and/or the prices by locking the transfer functions. 
- ButtCoin price does not depend on the ButtCoin team anymore, but mainly on a trade only. 
- ButtCoin has no right to choose which exchange ButtCoin will be listed on and which exchanges will be avoided.
- ButtCoin team can do and say whatever the fuck they want, without having any fucking impact on the fucking prices of a fucking project.

Cons: we are losing these functions
- We cannot lock: approve, transfer, transfer-from, and mint functions.
- We cannot add anyone to be an administrator.
- We cannot transfer any tokens without burning.
- We cannot allocate any tokens for exchange liquidity (this has to be done by the community).
- There are no white-lists, blacklists, or similar.
- We cannot burn any tokens suggesting a scam or illegal transactions.
- We cannot lock any function if we find a bug in the code for that function.
- Furthermore, should the mining difficulty become too high, we can never set it back to lower levels.

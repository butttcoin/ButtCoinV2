# REAPER TOKEN OVERVIEW

This is a quick overview of the Reaper token. It is a 0xBUTT promotional token for the Halloween 2019. It is a deflationary token, and one of a kind!
Our intention is to create the cruel and the scariest token that has ever been made.
Furthermore, our intention is to bring so much chaos, that anarchists would run away screaming like little girls.

There are two main periods. One is a sowing period and other is the reaping period.
- Sowing period consists of rewarding the token transfers, every 10 minutes, at random.
- Reaping period consists of burning the most inactive accounts and taking 50% from them.

We will automate the SNAYL model of a buffer which increases with the amount of transfers, also at random. 
Since the buffer is processed at random, it won't be possible to tell whether we are reaping or sowing and therefore we will create the complete chaos.

## Token allocation
We will leave 7 million (one third) for the owner account in order to be able to spread the tokens to exchanges for a liquidity.
We will have to make a white-list so that tokens on exchanges don't get burned.

## Reaping and sowing mechanism
First, we will do the sowing, then reaping and then repeat the both until 21 million tokens are distributed burned in such a manner.
Once 21 million is reached, we will start burning 1% from each transfer.

## Sowing mechanism
Any account that transfers a token can get a reward within a 10 minute frame since the last reward. 
The reward is going to be 200 tokens and it will be rewarded by minting new tokens adding them to a current supply.
After the rewards were distributed 256 times, the halving will happen, and the reaping period begins.

## Reaping mechanism
Any account making a transfer will get 50% from the last inactive account while the last inactive account tokens will be burned to a zero!
After 256 reaps, the sowing begins.

## Automated buffering mechanism
To escape the token manipulation, we will buffer the transfers. The buffer will grow, at random, with the amount of transfers.
The buffered transfers will be processed at random, and very soon, we won't be able to tell what is happening. It will become a complete state of a chaos!

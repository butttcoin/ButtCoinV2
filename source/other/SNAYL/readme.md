# UNDER CONSTRUCTION !

## WHERE IS MY AIRDROP ?
Relax, this is a Snayl token! Give it some time, it does things the way the snails do...
Here are the transaction IDs

## In no-technical terms, please explain, how does this token work ?
Imagine a room with 500 chairs. Every chair is numbered. Each time a person wants to make a transfer, they pick a number from a hat and they sit on the chair with the random number they got. If there is someone else sitting on the chair, they take 1% of their money and tell them to go and finish their transfer. THAT IS ALL! As you can see, it is very simple, however, the implications are huge. For example, if the person who is sitting on a chair wants to manipulate the market having a lot of money, they won't be able to do it since they won't have any idea when their chair-number will be picked. The chances are very low (0.2%) however, it will happen one day...


## Why the name SNAYL ?
First, we wanted to use the word "Snail" but it was overused just like the word "Butt" as in ButtCoin. We had to have something more unique. Second, it represents the speed at which transfers will happen on the network.

## Why the second project under the ButtCoin ?
We are bringing something new and less strict and rigid than a ButtCoin. We want people to be able to do everything with this token that they want to do with 0xBUTT, but can't due to 0xBUTT rules. For example, we want to list it on as many exchanges as possible, do the airdrops, and have all the fun we simply can't have with a ButtCoin. Also, we want to make people aware of the 0xBUTT (ButtCoin) project.

## Why is it so slow and how long does it take to process a transfer ?
The reason is because we want to create a deflationary token that has the following features:
- Token is deflationary
- Token is immune to market manipulations
- Token is not self-destructive (no burning)

There is no time involved in a transfer process. Instead, there is a 0.2% chance that your transfer will be processed each time someone else makes a transfer. Eventually, your transfer will process, but it could take time... This way, we are preventing the market manipulations since the market manipulators won't be able to controll their transfers as well as the market.

## How is this token deflationary ?
As mentioned, there is no burning involved. By definition, if we can lower the market concentration (the focus on a market trade and possible price manipulation) and focus on the competition, then we have a deflationary token.

## How do you focus on the competition more than on a market price manipulation ?
By making the token transfers impossible to predict, we are preventing the market concentration. Furthermore, by making the token more scarce and by buffering the transfers, we are increasing a demand as well as a competition.

## How do you plan to make the token more scarce ?
Simply because you are always processing someone else's transfer, you can take 1% from their transfer. Unfortunately, zero transfers are NOT allowed, but you may get no reward tokens if they transfer less than 100.

## Why the low supply and no decimals ?
We want to see the prices rise as well as a demand. Introducing decimals makes no sense for this project.

## I looked at the code, and saw a Turbo function. What is that for ?
It is for exchanges that demand an immediate transfer, since they cannot wait to list a token.

## Can I breed or squish the Snayls ?
Only a token owner can breed (introduce new tokens) or squish (that is, burn) the Snayls. Again, this was meant for the exchanges only, and as a safety feature, since we only have 100K tokens.

## ERC-20 Token Transfer Error (Unable to locate corresponding Transfer Event Logs), Check with Sender. 
This simply means that you have an empty place-holder and not processing anyone's transaction. It is not a bug/issue, just the way Ethereum was designed. We are pushing that design to a limit, and this is why you may see it. Ignore it, and move on. It is the expected behaviour. It is a warning saying that although the transfer was called, no logs were written... which is exactly what we want.
